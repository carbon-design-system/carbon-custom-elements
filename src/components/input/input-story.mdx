# Input

Text fields enable the user to interact with and input data.
A single line field is used when the input anticipated by the user is a single line of text as opposed to a paragraph.

## `<bx-input>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-input required>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-input>` without `required` attribute).

<Props of="bx-input" />
