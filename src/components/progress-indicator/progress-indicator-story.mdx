# Progress indicator

Progress indicator is a visual representation of a users progress through a set of steps. They guide the user through a number of steps in order to complete a specified process.

Use progress indicators to keep the user on track when completing a specific task. By dividing the end goal into smaller, sub-tasks, it increases the percentage of completeness as each task is completed.
