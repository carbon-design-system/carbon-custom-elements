# Combo box

Combo box realizes a notion of "filterable dropdown".
By default, the dropdown displays a label when closed. When the user hovers over the label area, a text cursor will appear.
The drawer opens on click (anywhere in the field) and the user can type to filter through the list of options below.
Once the user begins typing, the close (X) icon will appear to the right of the label.
This will clear any user-inputted text.
Selecting an item from the dropdown will close the drawer and the selected option will replace the default label.
