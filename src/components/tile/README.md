# Tile

Tiles are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content, including informational, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.

Carbon ships a basic tile structure that responds to the grid.
Tiles have no pre-set styles for the content within them. You can customize tiles to fit your specific use case.

When using a call-to-action (CTA) within a tile, use a secondary button.
Primary buttons should be reserved for the most important action a user can take on the page.
