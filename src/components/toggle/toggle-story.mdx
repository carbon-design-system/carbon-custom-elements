# Toggle

Toggle is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states.
Toggles are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips” the toggle switch.
They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

Use `small` property/attribute to make it more compact in size, so they can be used in use cases such as data tables.
