# Search

Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant pieces of content without the use of navigation.
Search can be used as the primary means of discovering content, or as a filter to aid the user in finding content.

## `<bx-search>` attributes, properties and events

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-search light>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-search>` without `light` attribute).
