# Loading

Loading spinners are used when retrieving data or performing slow computations, and help to notify users that loading is underway.
The waiting experience is a crucial design opportunity.
Although it may not be obvious what is occurring on the back-end, we can communicate clearly to reassure the user that progress is happening.

## `<bx-loading>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-loading inactive>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-loading>` without `inactive` attribute).

<Props of="bx-loading" />
