# Button

Buttons are used to initialize an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

There are several kinds of buttons:

- Primary buttons should be used for the principal call to action on the page.
- Secondary buttons should be used for secondary actions on each page.
- Danger buttons should be used for a negative action (such as Delete) on the page.

Small buttons may be used when there is not enough space for a regular sized button. This issue is most often found in tables. Small buttons should have three words or fewer.

When words are not enough, icons can be used in buttons to better communicate what the button does. Icons are always paired with text.

## `<bx-btn>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-btn autofocus>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-btn>` without `autofocus` attribute).
