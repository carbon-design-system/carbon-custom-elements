# Modal

Modals interrupt user workflow by design.
They are most effective when a task must be completed before a user can continue.
While effective when used correctly, modals should be used sparingly to limit disruption to a user experience.

## Focus management

`<bx-modal>` puts focus on one of the following elements (in priority order) once it gets open:

1. An programmatic-focusable element with `data-modal-primary-focus` attribute
2. The primary button in modal footer
3. The first sequential-focusable child element

`<bx-modal>` enables "focus-wrapping" behavior after then.
It means that hitting tab key at the last sequential-focusable element in `<bx-modal>` puts focus on the first sequential-focusable element, and hitting Shift-tab key at the first sequential-focusable element in `<bx-modal>` puts focus on the last sequential-focusable element.

Once `<bx-modal>` gets closed, it puts focus on the last focused element before it got open, typically the launcher button.

## `<bx-modal>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-modal open>`) and `false` means not setting the attribute (e.g. `<bx-modal>` without `open` attribute).

<Props of="bx-modal" />
