# Coding conventions

## Linters/formatters

`carbon-custom-elements` uses ESLint with `typescript-eslint` for linting, and Prettier for code formatting.
Most of ESLint configurations are same as ones in `carbon-components`.

## TSDoc comments

In addition to using TypeScript, we try to leverage editors' code assistance feature as much as possible.

For that purpose, we add TSDoc comments to the following:

- All classes
- All properties/methods (including private properties), only exception here is one being overriden
- All type definitions (e.g. `interface`, `enum`)

## Lifecycle management

To avoid memory leaks and zombie event listeners, we ensure the event listeners on custom elements themselves (hosts) and ones on `document`, etc. are released when they get out of render tree.

For that purpose, `carbon-custom-elements` uses `@HostListener(type, options)` decorator. `@HostListener(type, options)` decorator works with a custom element class inheriting `HostListenerMixin()` and attaches an event listener using the target method as the listener. The `type` argument can be something like `document:click` so the `click` event listener is attached to `document`.

Here's an example seen in `<bx-modal>` code:

```typescript
...
import HostListener from '../../globals/decorators/HostListener';
import HostListenerMixin from '../../globals/mixins/HostListener';
...

@customElement(`${prefix}-modal` as any)
class BXModal extends HostListenerMixin(LitElement) {
  ...

  @HostListener('click')
  // @ts-ignore: The decorator refers to this method but TS thinks this method is not referred to
  private _handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    ...
  };

  ...
}
```

## Component styles for different component states/variants

Carbon core CSS uses BEM modifier like `bx--btn--danger` to style different states/variants of a component.

OTOH `carbon-custom-elements` uses attributes to represent different states/variants (e.g. `<bx-btn type="danger">`), in a similar manner as how attributes influence states/variants of native elements (e.g. `<input type="hidden">`).

If such states/variants should affect the style of custom element (shadow host), we define attribute styles from the following reasons:

- Taking a cue from native elements with user agent shadow DOM (e.g. UA stylesheet for `<input type="hidden">`)
- [Adding CSS classes on our custom elements by ourselves may conflict with CSS classes set by consumers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices#do-not-self-apply-classes)

## Customizing components

Like `carbon-components` library does, `carbon-custom-elements` ensures components are written in a flexible manner enough to support use cases different applications have.

### Defining (default) component options

Component options are defined as static properties of custom element class, instead of in `options` object seen in `carbon-components`.

The primary reason for the difference is that [there is no support for constructor arguments in Custom Elements](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/605) and the use case for using constructor for Custom Elements is rare. It makes instance-level configuration unrealistic.

### Component variants with different options

A component variant with different options can be created by creating a derived class which overrides static properties of component options.

#### Areas to make them configurable as component options

- CSS selectors/classes used in imperative DOM API calls (Doing so allows overriding `.render()` method)
- [Custom event](#custom-events) names

#### Areas where component optinos are _not_ applied

- CSS classes used in template (Should be done by overriding `.render()` method)

## Polymorphism with static properties

To support [polymorphism with static properties](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/3841)...

We do:

```typescript
(this.constructor as typeof CustomElementClass).staticPropName;
```

```typescript
(customElementInstance.constructor as typeof CustomElementClass).staticPropName;
```

We don't:

```typescript
CustomElementClass.staticPropName;
```

## Custom events

Wherever it makes sense, `carbon-custom-elements` translates user-initiated events to something that gives event listeners more context of what they mean. For example, `<bx-modal>` translates `click` event on `<bx-modal-close-button>` to `bx-modal-beingclosed` and `bx-modal-closed` custom events.

`bx-modal-beingclosed` is cancelable in a similar manner as how `click` event on `<a href="...">` is cancelable; If `bx-modal-beingclosed` is canceled, `<bx-modal>` stops closing itself.

We define custom event names as static properties so derived classes can customize them.

## Custom element registration

This library registers custom elements to global `window` automatically upon importing the corresponding modules.
It may not be desirable in two scenarios:

- One is when consumer wants to customize our custom element's behavior before it's registered. In such case, consumer can create a derived class and register it with a different custom element name.
- Another, though the use case is rare, is using our custom element in a different realm. In such case, consumer can re-register the custom element in the realm.

## Propagating misc attributes from shadow host to an element in shadow DOM

Some components, e.g. `<bx-btn>`, simply represent the content in shadow DOM, e.g. `<button>` in it. It's sometimes desiable for applications to have control of attributes in `<button>`, for example, adding `data-` attributes there.

In such case, we let consumer create a derived class. For example, its `.attributeChangedCallback()` can propagate `<bx-btn>`'s attribute to `<button>` in it.
